# node-auth

The main purpose of this repository is to show a working Node.js API Server workflow in TypeScript. This project was built using TypeScript Node Starter package as a basic structure.

# Pre-reqs
To build and run this app locally you will need a few things:
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Getting started
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies
```
cd <project_name>
npm install
```
- Configure your mongoDB server
- Build and run the project
```
npm start
```

# Deploying the app
There are many ways to deploy an Node app, and in general, nothing about the deployment process changes because you're using TypeScript.
In this section, I'll walk you through how to deploy this app to Azure App Service using the extensions available in VS Code because I think it is the easiest and fastest way to get started, as well as the most friendly workflow from a developer's perspective.

## Prerequisites
- [**Azure account**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) - If you don't have one, you can sign up for free.
The Azure free tier gives you plenty of resources to play around with including up to 10 App Service instances, which is what we will be using.
- [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - We'll be using the interface provided by VS Code to quickly deploy our app.
- [**Azure App Service VS Code extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice) - In VS Code, search for `Azure App Service` in the extension marketplace (5th button down on the far left menu bar), install the extension, and then reload VS Code.
- **Create a cloud database** -
For local development, running MongoDB on localhost is fine, however once we deploy we need a database with high availability.
The easiest way to achieve this is by using a managed cloud database.
There are many different providers, but the easiest one to get started with is [MongoLab](#mlab).
- **SendGrid Account** -
If you don't have one, you can sign up for free, we will need it to send emails. There are many different providers that Nodemailer supports ([Well-known services](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/well-known/)), we'll be using [SendGrid](#sendgrid).

### Build the app
Building the app locally is required to generate a zip to deploy because the App Service won't execute build tasks.
Build the app however you normally would:
- `ctrl + shift + b` - kicks off default build in VS Code
- execute `npm run build` from a terminal window

# TypeScript + Node
In the next few sections I will call out everything that changes when adding TypeScript to an Express project.
Note that all of this has already been setup for this project, but feel free to use this as a reference for converting other Node.js projects to TypeScript.

## Getting TypeScript
TypeScript itself is simple to add to any project with `npm`.
```
npm install -D typescript
```
If you're using VS Code then you're good to go!
VS Code will detect and use the TypeScript version you have installed in your `node_modules` folder.
For other editors, make sure you have the corresponding [TypeScript plugin](http://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links).

## Project Structure
The most obvious difference in a TypeScript + Node project is the folder structure.
In a TypeScript project, it's best to have separate _source_  and _distributable_ files.
TypeScript (`.ts`) files live in your `src` folder and after compilation are output as JavaScript (`.js`) in the `dist` folder.
The `test` and `views` folders remain top level as expected.

The full folder structure of this app is explained below:

> **Note!** Make sure you have already built the app using `npm run build`

## Building the project
It is rare for JavaScript projects not to have some kind of build pipeline these days, however Node projects typically have the least amount of build configuration.
Because of this I've tried to keep the build as simple as possible.
If you're concerned about compile time, the main watch task takes ~2s to refresh.

### Configuring TypeScript compilation
TypeScript uses the file `tsconfig.json` to adjust project compile options.
Let's dissect this project's `tsconfig.json`, starting with the `compilerOptions` which details how your project is compiled.
```json
"compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "target": "es6",
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
        "*": [
            "node_modules/*",
            "src/types/*"
        ]
    }
},
```

### Running the build
All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.
This is nice because most JavaScript tools have easy to use command line utilities allowing us to not need grunt or gulp to manage our builds.
If you open `package.json`, you will see a `scripts` section with all the different scripts you can call.
To call a script, simply run `npm run <script-name>` from the command line.
You'll notice that npm scripts can call each other which makes it easy to compose complex builds out of simple individual build scripts.
Below is a list of all the scripts this template has available:


| Npm Script | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                   | Does the same as 'npm run serve'. Can be invoked with `npm start`                                 |
| `build`                   | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks (`build-sass`, `build-ts`, `lint`, `copy-static-assets`)       |
| `serve`                   | Runs node on `dist/server.js` which is the apps entry point                                       |
| `watch-node`              | Runs node with nodemon so the process restarts if it crashes. Used in the main watch task         |
| `watch`                   | Runs all watch tasks (TypeScript, Sass, Node). Use this if you're not touching static assets.     |
| `test`                    | Runs tests using Jest test runner                                                                 |
| `watch-test`              | Runs tests in watch mode                                                                          |
| `build-ts`                | Compiles all source `.ts` files to `.js` files in the `dist` folder                                 |
| `watch-ts`                | Same as `build-ts` but continuously watches `.ts` files and re-compiles when needed                |
| `build-sass`              | Compiles all `.scss` files to `.css` files                                                          |
| `watch-sass`              | Same as `build-sass` but continuously watches `.scss` files and re-compiles when needed            |
| `lint`                    | Runs ESLint on project files                                                                       |
| `copy-static-assets`      | Calls script that copies JS libs, fonts, and images to dist directory                             |
| `debug`                   | Performs a full build and then serves the app in watch mode                                       |
| `serve-debug`             | Runs the app with the --inspect flag                                                               |
| `watch-debug`             | The same as `watch` but includes the --inspect flag so you can attach a debugger                   |

### Installing `.d.ts` files from DefinitelyTyped
For the most part, you'll find `.d.ts` files for the libraries you are using on DefinitelyTyped.
These `.d.ts` files can be easily installed into your project by using the npm scope `@types`.
For example, if we want the `.d.ts` file for jQuery, we can do so with `npm install --save-dev @types/jquery`.

> **Note!** Be sure to add `--save-dev` (or `-D`) to your `npm install`. `.d.ts` files are project dependencies, but only used at compile time and thus should be dev dependencies.

In this template, all the `.d.ts` files have already been added to `devDependencies` in `package.json`, so you will get everything you need after running your first `npm install`.
Once `.d.ts` files have been installed using npm, you should see them in your `node_modules/@types` folder.
The compiler will always look in this folder for `.d.ts` files when resolving JavaScript libraries.

### What if a library isn't on DefinitelyTyped?
If you try to install a `.d.ts` file from `@types` and it isn't found, or you check DefinitelyTyped and cannot find a specific library, you will want to create your own `.d.ts file`.
In the `src` folder of this project, you'll find the `types` folder which holds the `.d.ts` files that aren't on DefinitelyTyped (or weren't as of the time of this writing).

#### Setting up TypeScript to look for `.d.ts` files in another folder
The compiler knows to look in `node_modules/@types` by default, but to help the compiler find our own `.d.ts` files we have to configure path mapping in our `tsconfig.json`.
Path mapping can get pretty confusing, but the basic idea is that the TypeScript compiler will look in specific places, in a specific order when resolving modules, and we have the ability to tell the compiler exactly how to do it.
In the `tsconfig.json` for this project you'll see the following:
```json
"baseUrl": ".",
"paths": {
    "*": [
        "node_modules/*",
        "src/types/*"
    ]
}
```
This tells the TypeScript compiler that in addition to looking in `node_modules/@types` for every import (`*`) also look in our own `.d.ts` file location `<baseUrl>` + `src/types/*`.
So when we write something like:
```ts
import * as flash from "express-flash";
```
First the compiler will look for a `d.ts` file in `node_modules/@types` and then when it doesn't find one look in `src/types` and find our file `express-flash.d.ts`.

#### Writing a `.d.ts` file
If generating a `.d.ts` using `dts-gen` isn't working, [you should tell me about it first](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LN2CV82), but then you can create your own `.d.ts` file.

If you just want to silence the compiler for the time being, create a file called `<some-library>.d.ts` in your `types` folder and then add this line of code:
```ts
declare module "<some-library>";
```
If you want to invest some time into making a great `.d.ts` file that will give you great type checking and IntelliSense, the TypeScript website has great [docs on authoring `.d.ts` files](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html).

## ESLint
ESLint is a code linter which mainly helps catch quickly minor code quality and style issues.

### ESLint rules
Like most linters, ESLint has a wide set of configurable rules as well as support for custom rule sets.
All rules are configured through `.eslintrc` configuration file.
In this project, we are using a fairly basic set of rules with no additional custom rules.

### Running ESLint
Like the rest of our build steps, we use npm scripts to invoke ESLint.
To run ESLint you can call the main build script or just the ESLint task.
```
npm run build   // runs full build including ESLint
npm run lint    // runs only ESLint
```
Notice that ESLint is not a part of the main watch task.
